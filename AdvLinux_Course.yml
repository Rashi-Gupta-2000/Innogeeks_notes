- create an ec2 instance with key pair

Some best practises to follow in linux for security purpose-
1. Enforce the Login Password Strong Policy - the password has no expiry and will last forever 
    (passwd - set the password for a user)
    sudo nano login.defs
    - PASS_MAX_DAYS setting should change to a smaller no. of days. This basically set the life to the current password.
    - Create a rule for a Complex Password
      - sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
      - go to /etc/pam.d/
      - sudo nano common-password
  
  minlen=6 maxrepeat=3 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1 difok=4 reject_username enforce_for_root
    
        retry=3: This option will prompt the user 3 times before exiting and returning an error.
        minlen=12: This specifies that the password cannot be less than 12 characters.
        maxrepeat=3: This allows implies that only a maximum of 3 repeated characters can be included in the password.
        ucredit=-1: The option requires at least one uppercase character in the password.
        lcredit=-1: The option requires at least one lowercase character in the password.
        dcredit=-1: This implies that the password should have at last a numeric character.
        ocredit=-1: The option requires at least one special character included in the password.
        difok=3: This implies that only a  maximum of 3 character changes in the new password should be present in the old password.
        reject_username: The option rejects a password if it consists of the username either in its normal way or in reverse.
        enforce_for_root: This ensures that the password policies are adhered to even if it's the root user configuring the passwords.

2. SSH Hardening Process
  - go to the file location /etc/ssh/ 
  - sudo nano sshd_config
  1. Disable Empty Password
    - PermitEmptyPassword no 
  2. Default Port SSH from 22(default) to something else like 2121 (change in ec2 instance port range as well)
  3. Disable root login to SSH
    - PermitRootLogin no
  4. Configure the SSH Protocol
    - Protocol 2 (ssh version 1 and version 2)
  5. Idle Timeout
    - ClientAliveInterval 120 --> 120 seconds
  6.Allow Specific group of users or specific user to the SSH Protocol 
    - AllowUsers User1, User2, User3
    - AllowGroups Group1, Group2, Group3
  7. Disable password based SSH
    - PasswordAuthentication no (should always have the key)

restart sshd service -- sudo systemctl restart sshd
